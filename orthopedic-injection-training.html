<p>In medication, a joint shot (intra-articular injection) is a treatment made use of in the treatment of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and occasionally osteo arthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused right into the impacted joint where it delivers a dose of any kind of one of numerous anti-inflammatory agents, one of the most usual of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, as a result of its high viscosity, is occasionally used to change bursa liquids. The technique might be utilized to also withdraw excess fluid from the joint.</p>
