<p>In medication, a joint shot (intra-articular shot) is a procedure used in the therapy of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid joint inflammation, psoriatic arthritis, gout pain, tendinitis, bursitis, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and periodically osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused right into the influenced joint where it delivers a dosage of any one of several anti-inflammatory agents, one of the most usual of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, because of its high viscosity, is occasionally utilized to replace bursa fluids. The technique might be utilized to additionally withdraw excess liquid from the joint.</p>
