<p>In medication, a joint injection (intra-articular shot) is a treatment used in the treatment of inflammatory joint problems, such as rheumatoid joint inflammation, psoriatic joint inflammation, gout arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, Repetitive strain injury, and sometimes osteo arthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused right into the influenced joint where it supplies a dosage of any type of one of many anti-inflammatory representatives, the most usual of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, because of its high thickness, is sometimes used to change bursa fluids. The technique might be utilized to also take out excess fluid from the joint.</p>
